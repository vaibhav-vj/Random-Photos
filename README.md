# Dynamic Image Gallery

This is a simple JavaScript program that dynamically generates a gallery of random images when a button is clicked. Each time the button is clicked, it adds a specified number of images to the gallery, with each image being sourced from the [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) service.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click on the button labeled "Generate Images".

## Functionality

The program consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage, including a container element for the gallery and a button to generate images.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the gallery and button.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to dynamically generate and append images to the gallery.

When the button is clicked, the `addNewImages` function in `script.js` is executed. This function generates a specified number of `img` elements and appends them to the container element in the HTML file. Each image is sourced from Lorem Picsum with a random width and height, ensuring variety in the gallery.

## Modifications

To customize the program, you can:

- Change the number of images generated by modifying the `imageNum` variable in `script.js`.
- Adjust the size of the images by modifying the width and height parameters in the `newImage.src` assignment in `script.js`.
- Update the styles of the gallery and button by modifying the CSS in `styles.css`.
